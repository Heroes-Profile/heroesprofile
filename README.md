# Heroes Profile

 [Heroes Profile](https://alpha.heroesprofile.com/) is an open Heroes of the Storm stat site.  Providing players with Global Hero Statistics, Personal Profile, MMR, Comparisons, Amateur series, and much more.

 This public repository is the site re-write for [Heroes Profile](https://www.heroesprofile.com/) and is not currently in production.

 # Installation

 Heroes Profile is a PHP/Laravel and vue.js app. Making use of a MySql database.  Every system has different methods for getting the required dependencies installed so please reference the main tools sites for installation instructions.

 Laravel - https://laravel.com/

 Vue.js - https://vuejs.org/

 PHP - PHP can be installed in different ways.  If you do not currently have PHP installed, use google to find the best method for you.
 * Increase your local PHP memory_limit var.  We use 1g.  memory_limit = 1G

 MySQL - MySQL can be installed in different ways.  If you do not currently have MySQL installed, use google to find the best method for you.

 Optional - A visual tool for looking at the database and data is suggested.  MySql Workbench is our preference - https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/


 In addition to creating the environment yourself, there are also a lot of different tools that can pull together all the dependencies for you.  Homestead is an example.

 For windows users, Wampserver64 is a useful tool as it installs the MySql server and php at the same time. https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/
